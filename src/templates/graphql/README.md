# Create Rara App

A   react app graphql templates to be used within the organization. The template is created with discussed sets of packages.

### Scaffolding Your Rara App
```javascript
npx create-rara-app folderName
```
### Has Commit Lint enabled

>You need to follow the [commit conventions](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/) and remove all the warnings and error to commit.


### .env File
The .env files have some predefined key value pairs that are generated based on the answer you've given while scaffolding the app.

> If you didn't provide any values, then a default path will be set. This env variables are used for api request in axios configuration file and if graphql is used then the VITE_SCHEMA_PATH will be used to set the path of schema

Where are the env variables used?
- src/generated/axiosHelper.ts (VITE_API_URL)
- codegen.yml (VITE_SCHEMA_URL)


```javascript
VITE_SCHEMA_PATH = http://localhost:9000/query
VITE_API_URL = http://localhost:9000/query
```

## Folder Structure

```
--src
-----components
-----constant
-----functions
-----generated
-----graphql
-----hooks
-----pages
-----routes
-----theme
```

> Do not make any edits to generated folder. This is where all the  typings for api calls (with graphql) are generated by [graphql-code-gnerator](https://www.graphql-code-generator.com/) along with [react-query plugin](https://www.graphql-code-generator.com/plugins/typescript-react-query).

### Misc.

**public/__redirects** is used to prevent *page not found* issue on reload after deploying on netlify
